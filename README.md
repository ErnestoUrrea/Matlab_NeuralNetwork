# MATLAB Neural Network
A second (and more successful) attempt to build a Neural Network from scratch on MATLAB. To see the first attempt (not recommended) check the folder `old_firstattempt` on this repository.

The objective of this project is learning about the basic work principles of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. This project was made using concepts from the Intermediate Mathematical Modeling (MA1029) class taken on March 2022 at the Tecnologico de Monterrey, in Monterrey, Mexico. Another great support resource for this project was the [AI YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Ogd76BhmcB9OjPucsnc2-piEE96jJDQ&si=unqUJHm6ifEYXdXz) by Dot CSV.

## Development Log
In case I want to revisit this repository and don't fully understand my code, this is a log of my thought process during the development of this project.

To avoid the error made in my first attempt, of trying to start too big, and then getting lost in the complexity and lack of organization and documentation of my code, I decided to start small this time. My first objective was to understand the basic properties and structure of a Neural Network and develop a method of visualizing the results. This can be seen in the script [`Manually_Defined_Neural_Network_Visualization.m`](/Manually_Defined_Neural_Network_Visualization.m), where I define a 1 layer neural network to perform the classification of 4 sets of points in 2 groups.
